# Ray Shape Intersection Formula

## Plane

For the plane F(x,y,z) = z, the ray p+t*d intersects when the linear expression b*t + c = 0, with

b = dz
c = pz

This has one solution t. If t is negative, it is invalid (no intersection).

The normal to this plane is < 0, 0, 1 >.

## Sphere

For the unit sphere F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1, the ray p+t*d intersects when the quadratic expression a*t^2 + b*t + c = 0, with

a = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2  
b = 2*( px*dx + py*dy + pz*dz )  
c = px^2 + py^2 + pz^2 - 1.0

The normal to this sphere is < 2*x, 2*y, 2*z >, where x,y,z are a point on the sphere.

## Cylinder

For the body of the cylinder F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - 1, the ray p+t*d intersects when the quadratic expression a*t^2 + b*t + c = 0, with

a = dx^2 + dy^2
b = 2*( px*dx + py*dy )
c = px^2 + py^2 - 1.0

This has zero, one, or two solutions. If one of the solution t is negative, it is invalid. If the point q=p+t*d has z coordinate outside [0,1], that t is invalid.

The normal to the body is < 2*x, 2*y, 0 >, where x,y,z are a point on the cylinder.

The bottom face F(x,y,z) = -z is the same as the Plane shape above.

For the top face F(x,y,z) = z - 1, the ray p+t*d intersects when the linear expression b*t + c = 0, with

b = dz  
c = pz - 1

The normal to the top plane is < 0, 0, 1 >.

If the solution t for the top or bottom face is negative or produces a point q=p+t*d whose qx^2+qy^2 > 1, that solution t is invalid.

## Cone

For the body of the cone F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - (1-z)^2, the ray p+t*d intersects when the quadratic expression a*t^2 + b*t + c = 0, with

a = dx^2 + dy^2 - dz^2
b = 2*( px*dx + py*dy + (1-pz)*dz )
c = px^2 + py^2 - (1-pz)^2

This has zero, one, or two solutions. If one of the solution t is negative, it is invalid. If the point q=p+t*d has z coordinate outside [0,1], that t is invalid.

The normal to the body is < 2*x, 2*y, 2*(1-z) >, where x,y,z are a point on the cone.

The bottom face F(x,y,z) = -z is the same as the Plane shape above.
If the solution t for the bottom face produces a point q=p+t*d whose qx^2+qy^2 > 1, that solution t is invalid.


## Cube

For the face x = `sign`, where sign is +1 or -1 and x could just as easily be y or z, F(x,y,z) = sign*x - 1, the ray p+t*d intersects when the linear expression b*t + c = 0, with

b = dx  
c = px - sign

This has one solution t. If t is negative, it is invalid (no intersection).
If the solution t produces a point q=p+t*d either of whose other two coordinates (e.g. q.y and q.z if we are looking at the cube face x = 1) are outside [-1,1], that t is invalid.

The normal to the face has "sign" as its x coordinate. The other coordinates are zero.
