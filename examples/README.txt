# README

* The `.json` files are scene files the program takes as input.
* The `-raycasting.png` files are what you should see as output with a raycaster (Homework 2).
* The `-raytracing.png` files are what you should see as output with a raytracer (Homework 3) with max_recursion = 3.

The other files show various steps of the transition from a raycaster to a raytracer.

* The `-ambient.png` files are what you should see with only ambient color (no diffuse, specular, reflections, or refraction). Note that only `orthographic_test1.json`, `camera_test2.json`, and `cone_cube.json` have something interesting to test for ambient color.
* The `-diffuse.png` files are what you should see with only diffuse lighting.
* The `-specular.png` files are what you should see with only specular lighting.
* The `-ambient_diffuse_specular.png` files are what you should see with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
* The `-ambient_diffuse_specular_shadows.png` files are what you should see with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting along with shadows.
* The `-diffuse_reflections_recursions_3.png` files are what you should see with only diffuse lighting and reflections with max_recursion = 3.
